This repository contains source files for notes on various topics as I go through. These notes are only to refer back what I learnt/understood. These are more kind of rough college notes so might be difficult to follow along.

This book is written in [BookDown](https://bookdown.org/), GitBook kind of book using RMarkDown.

It can be accessed from this [link](http://iyadavvaibhav.github.io/vybook/).

Thank you.
